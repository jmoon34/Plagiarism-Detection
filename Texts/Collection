The report judged innovation by a metric of patents created, innovation environment, startup performance and supporting resources. The US, Japan, Switzerland, South Korea and Israel were noted as models for tech and internet innovation. China performed best in supporting resources due to the RMB191bn in R&D investment in 2013, second only to the US. Despite huge amounts of money poured into R&D and startups in recent years and a few runaway successes, large scale innovation in China is still tripped up by regulatory hurdles and lagging infrastructure. To combat this, many local governments are attempting to create innovation islands. For example, Guangdong was rated second in the country the seventh year in a row in 2014 with 2.4% of the province\u2019s gross provincial product going to R&D, setting up several innovation zones with looser regulation and improved infrastructure as incubators and start up financing platforms. Guangdong is currently holding a week-long conference to discuss new methods to further promote innovation."

Since March 18, the average price of hogs has increased by 49.1% from RMB11.6 per kilogram to RMB17.3 per kilogram. A continued drop in supply was cited as a major reason for the price rise. Pork price, a key element of food prices and CPI, usually draws much attention if it changes considerably. The domestic pork price reached a peak in 2011 and kept going down until 2015, leading to a 3% drop in hog supplies in the past three years. Driven by pork price increases, relevant breeding firms such as Guangdong Dahuanong Animal Health [300186:CH], Muyuan Foodstuff [002714:CH], and Fujian Sunner Development [002299:CH] saw their share prices rise quickly.

Disappointing sales due to unexpectedly antagonistic regulations around the distribution of prescription drugs are expected to have played a leading role. Despite these setbacks, some medical e-commerce platforms managed to sustain growth with 111.com announcing on July 11 that its 1H15 revenue grew 400% YoY. While the fledgling Chinese medical e-commerce industry shows potential for rapid growth, this series of resignations points to potential bottlenecks. In a report published by Chinese E-Commerce Research Center, average net profit for B2C medical e-commerce platforms in 2013 was -1.3%. While medical e-commerce platforms require huge investments in distribution channel and human capital, they are banned from selling high-demand and high-margin prescription drugs, and are at a competitive disadvantage compared to traditional pharmacies, although this may begin to change under the new pharmaceutical price reform which will allow online vendors to price more competitively. Gaining access to prescription drugs would also expand medical e-commerce from its current RMB200bn OTC market to the entire RMB3tr drug market. In March 27, National Health and Family Planning Commission issued a statement postponing the clearance for online distribution of prescription drugs, stating that the regulatory framework is not sound enough to protect consumers from frauds. Nevertheless, many e-commerce platforms have been covertly selling prescription drugs. JXDYF.com for instance faces multiple lawsuits from customers who bought prescription drugs and later suffered major side-effects."

This is rather discouraging as the company yielded losses in 2013 and 2014 as well, at RMB480m and RMB1.26bn, respectively. If the company is unable to pull-through and produce profit by the year\u2019s end, it will have to delist from the Shenzhen exchange after having already received warnings. Noting the consistent loss it has been suffering in the past two and a half years, a comeback seems unlikely. Facing immense pressure to produce profits within the last half of the year, Faw Xiali\u2019s fate is looking rather grim as it is just one of many automakers to feel the burden of declining sales; China Association of Automobile Manufacturers data shows that auto sales growth slowed to 1.43% nationwide in 1H15. Some experts attribute the company\u2019s failure to keep up in the industry to its lack of adopting new technology, having adhered to traditional methods of production without adapting to market changes, thus decreasing its competitiveness in the field."

In comparison to previous statements made by the State Council, this placed a heavier emphasis on lowering tariffs and facilitating convenient cross border trade, although no concrete policies were announced. Many of the obstacles currently facing cross border e-commerce are regulatory. High tariffs, complicated and lengthy customs procedures, as well as outright bans on certain items, such as gaming systems, are being gradually addressed by regulatory bodies. However, the speed of reform as of yet has not been capable of keeping up with Chinese consumer\u2019s demands for foreign goods or e-commerce giants\u2019 desire to access foreign markets. For the time being, such regulations will likely continue to be a hurdle as lower level departments attempt to follow the line of reform established by the State Council, avoiding making any abrupt reform without clearer guidance from above."

LeShi [300104] also announced an ecosystem strategy on July 14, incentivizing developers with an equity partnership program. As the number and variety of smart devices increase, integration becomes increasingly important. A larger ecosystem collects and processes data more effectively and delivers a superior user experience. Yun OS is crucial to Alibaba\u2019s ecosystem strategy, as the operating system acts as a common language bridging different devices. Information security is a significant obstacle, however, as an interconnected platform has the potential to give hackers access to all of users\u2019 information through a loophole in just one terminal device; Alibaba has been ramping up its security expertise accordingly, snapping up smaller companies and reportedly working in coordination with the government to develop an internet security system. Yun OS\u2019s success also hinges on Alibaba\u2019s ability to cooperate with hardware manufacturers, software developers, and content producers. In March, Alibaba formed a JV with SAIC Motor [600104] to develop internet of cars technologies using Yun OS."

GDP growth for 1H15 also reached 7%, higher than the expected 6.9%. For the first half of 2015, urban fixed asset investment increased 11.4% YoY, total retail sales of consumer goods rose 10.4% YoY, and value added of above-size industries rose 6.3% YoY, all exceeding expectations. Power generation was up 0.6% YoY in 1H15 from a 0.2% rise for the first five months of 2015. Sales area of commodity housing increased 3.9% YoY in 1H15, reversing the 0.2% drop for the first five months, and sales value of commodity housing climbed 10.0% YoY, 6.9 ppts higher than that in the first five months. The better-than-expected macro data for 1H15 illustrates that the Chinese economy is stabilizing amid ongoing structural reforms, though it still faces downward pressure. However, the stabilization is not stable on concern of sluggish production. More stimulus measures are expected to be rolled out to underpin the recovery, and we think the world\u2019s second largest economy is very likely to bottom out in 2H15 as further stimulus kicks in."

The fast growth of online travel agencies also pushes hotel groups into a dilemma. OTAs like Ctrip [CTRP:US], Qunar [QUNR:US], and eLong [LONG:US] all try to capture more market share by giving out high subsidies to consumers while forcing traditional hotels to cut prices. If hotel groups do not lower prices, their market share will be occupied by irrational competitors, but if they lower the price, their profit will be squeezed by online travel agencies. On the other hand, it is still debatable whether this alliance will work or not because those six hotel groups are also competing with each other. As customer resources are precious to all of them, no one truly intends to share the information with others."

This marks the first time 3D printing has been used to treat such a tumor. Deformities or weakening of the sacrum, located at the base of the vertebral column between the hip bones, can lead to a lifetime of complications, including the inability to stand or walk. 3D printing for medical purposes is beginning to see more widespread usage in China. A 3-year-old girl successfully underwent a complex jaw separation procedure at the Guangzhou Women and Children\u2019s Medical Center in June, after doctors printed out a scale model of the child\u2019s jaw and skull to properly visualize the procedure prior to execution. Another woman became the first to receive a 3D printed titanium sternal implant in Xi\u2019an on July 9. Recent guidelines for the management and approval of 3D printing for medical purposes established by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) in June 2015 should increase the speed of approvals for new technologies. Guangdong Silver Age [300221:CH], Sichuan Languag Development [600466:CH] and Shenzhen Sunshine Laser [300227:CH] are some of the companies currently developing 3D printing technologies, with Sunshine Laser specializing in medical applications."

Although some of the content distributors have denied knowledge of new regulations, it is possible the new regulations have not yet been officially transmitted from the licensed providers to the third-party content distributors. The regulations outlined are consistent with SAPPRFT\u2019s past moves. In 2011, SAPPRFT stipulated that only licensed providers approved by the state can provide content through internet. All companies with internet TV services or set-top boxes for third-party content distribution must be affiliated with one of the licensed providers.

Weibo and Alibaba have had a long history of cooperation, beginning with Alibaba\u2019s early investment in Weibo and followed by the joint roll out of Weibo\u2019s payment features. This most recent cooperation provides obvious benefits to both parties: increasing traffic and purchases as well as creating an additional source of revenue. The cooperation to provide streaming of court cases seems unusual as it unlikely that the majority of cases would have a wide audience, although a few recent cases which were broadcast online received an audience of 1.2m and 4m viewers. This is more likely intended as a public service, with a representative of Weibo previously stating that the service would increase the public credibility of courts."

Datebao is able to offer customized products relevant to each user\u2019s lifestyle at low cost due to its automated big data computation and fast online distribution channel independent of brokerages.

If the mainland IPO is resumed and Deppon Logistics is successfully listed on the SSE, it would become the first less-than-carload logistics (LCL) giant to debut on the market. However, it is highly likely that the IPO freeze will persist for some time. Established in September 1996, the company has over 5,300 retail stores and 9,300 delivery cars across China. Its main businesses compose of LCL services, truck-load transportation, and delivery services. Gross profits of Deppon Logistics from 2012 to 2014 were RMB1.41bn, RMB1.58bn, and RMB1.86bn, with gross profit rates at 23.32%, 18.33%, and 17.77%, respectively; the decreasing gross profit rate was mainly due to VAT reform. As most of Chinese logistic companies are private, the planned listing of Deppon Logistics may encourage more logistics players to seek IPOs. The major rival of Deppon, Shanghai ANE Logistics Ltd, which just completed Series D financing of USD170m, is also planning to go public in two years."

This is a revision of a statement in February 2015 by CEO Terry Gou plotting 70% automation percent of assembly lines within just three years. Labor conditions at the manufacturer\u2019s plants have been a sticking point for rights watch groups. The company urged caution with the Guangdong government\u2019s plan to invest RMB943bn by 2018 in the automation industry as it might exacerbate the domestic labor shortage and economic slowdown. Foxconn employs more than 1 million workers, mostly in its Chinese factories. In a bid to slim the workforce and build new sales channels, the company is leaning towards robotics, which is becoming a trend in China, which bristled with some 200,000 intelligent robots. Currently, the company\u2019s factories are already filled with over 50,000 fully operational industrial robots, as well as other automated equipment. In June 2015, Alibaba Group [BABA:US] and Foxconn each invested JPY14.5bn in Soft Bank Robotics, developer of the Pepper humanoid robot. Such a move presumably reflects Foxconn\u2019s attempt to increase both production and distribution, given that the company has been eyeing India, investing UDS3.5bn to plant factories in that market."

The fundraising was done within a matter of two weeks, indicating VC\u2019s growing interest in the area of internet B2B services as represented by the SaaS market. A big selling point for SaaS services is their potential to reduce IT costs for corporations by outsourcing hardware and software maintenance to the SaaS provider. While SaaS is a mature market in US predicted to top USD22bn by the end of 2015, it is still an emerging market in China with no clear winners."

The two companies have had a strategic agreement since December 2013. Cheetah Mobile specializes in mobile advertising, corresponding to Tencent\u2019s most popular product, WeChat. As Tencent attempts to further monetize this mobile platform, the company is working on standardized formats for mobile ads to let a larger number of advertisers create their ads more efficiently. Total revenue in China\u2019s mobile ads market is expected to double to RMB61bn this year from RMB29.7bn, and estimates indicate it will grow more than sevenfold in 2018. However, Tencent\u2019s advertising business faces fierce competition from Baidu [BIDU:US] and Alibaba [BABA:US] which increasingly conduct advertising business in-house.

The initiative was motivated by the fact that while Guangzhou scored significant growth in e-commerce, achieving 163.1% revenue growth from 2012 to 2014, it has yet to have a company comparable to Hangzhou\u2019s Alibaba, Shenzhen\u2019s Tencent, or Beijing\u2019s Baidu.

Sales and income of the company increased over ten times in the past twelve years, and the stock price also increased from RMB3 to RMB30. However, Lu Zhou Lao Jiao recorded lower earnings the last two years due as the industry went through a correction. The new chairman Liu Miao said in the following three years, the company will attempt to recover sales of its key product National Cellar 1573 series, whose prices have dropped significantly as a result of the industry downturn. Currently, high-end liquor products account for 18% of Lu Zhou Lao Jiao products, mid-range 12%, and low-end 70%. The company expects mid-range and high-end products to exceed 50% by 2015. Lu Zhou Lao Jiao\u2019s gross profit rate has remained over 50% for five consecutive years, but its net profit decreased sharply last year, dropping from RMB3.44bn in 2013 to RMB0.88bn in 2014. Net profit growth for the last two years was -74.41% and -21.69%, respectively. The share price of Lu Zhou Lao Jiao has increased about 99% ytd, mainly due to the incoming IPO of Huaxi Securities, of which Lu Zhou Lao Jiao Group, the parent of Lu Zhou Lao Jiao, is the largest shareholder. Lu Zhou Lao Jiao also holds a 12.99% stake in Huaxi Securities. China\u2019s baijiu industry underwent a period of deep correction with the launch of China\u2019s anti-corruption campaign in 2012.

New orders came in at 50.1, down 0.5 from the previous month, indicating demand growth in manufacturing activities slowed. The HSBC China manufacturing PMI rose to a three-month high of 49.4 in June, lower than the preliminary reading of 49.6 but higher than May\u2019s 49.2; the figure has been in contraction territory for four consecutive months. China non-manufacturing PMI rose to 53.8 in June from 53.2 in May. The official and HSBC manufacturing PMI figures were both weaker than expected since the market had anticipated a stronger recovery in the manufacturing sector after a slew of supportive policies. Despite the slight rise in HSBC\u2019s June figure, employment remained sluggish, calling for continued policy easing as downward pressure still weighs on the Chinese economy. However, non-manufacturing PMI showed significant improvement in June, illustrating that the service sector has a stronger resilience to economic downturn amid ongoing structural adjustments."

In light of economic slowdown, China is stepping up efforts to stabilize growth via investment, with a priority in infrastructure investment. Aside from RMB1tr of investment packages announced so far, NDRC also released approximately RMB2tr of PPP projects to encourage participation of private capital. Although boosting domestic consumption has been regarded as a key goal for this year, investment seems to remain the most effective way to stabilize growth amid a slowing economy. Fueled by policy stimulus, China\u2019s infrastructure investment reached RMB3.8tr in the first five months of 2015, up 18.7% YoY, much higher than that of total investment, manufacturing, and real estate in the same period."

Incentives such as allowing new customers to try the service for free or at a discount have been offered as well. Baidu is the last of the BAT trio to enter the ride sharing and taxi app market. Didi-Kuaidi is currently backed by Tencent [0700:HK] and Alibaba [BABA:US] and has been reported as controlling over 80% of the market, although estimates vary. Recent rumors that Didi Taxi was preparing to buy out Shenzhou Zhuanche have been denied. Baidu has already established relations with Uber, investing an estimated USD600m in the company and making Uber services accessible in Baidu Maps. As a foreign service, Uber has had to invest greatly in its efforts to break into the domestic market and has still faced some opposition. Baidu will have an advantage due to its widely used Baidu Maps app, greatly decreasing distribution and the cost of advertising, as well as its status as a domestic company."

The company wrote 630m policies in 2014 to 150 individual clients. This however was driven by product return insurance for e-commerce platforms.

The state-owned conglomerate has been attempting to list since 2004, when it tried to go public in Hong Kong but failed to get government approval due to restrictions on foreign investment in China\u2019s film industry. China Film Group restarted its listing plan in 2007, forming a new joint stock company with China Broadcasting Corporation, Jiangsu Broadcasting Corporation, China United Network Communications Ltd [600050:CH] and four other companies, but again failed to list. In June 2014, China Film Group raised RMB4.6bn to prepare for an IPO, but was denied in February after failing to provide required documents. China Film Group plays a central role in China\u2019s booming film industry, but has lagged in terms of producing its own hit movies as privately owned companies and foreign films have stepped up the competition. China Film Group is the gatekeeper for any foreign film that wants to be shown in Chinese theaters. The company\u2019s profits have fluctuated over the last few years, coming in at RMB515m in 2011, RMB560m in 2012 and RMB428m in 2013, even as China\u2019s movie box office sales have boomed. Listed movie production firms include Zhejiang Huace Film and TV Co [300133:CH] and Huayi Brothers Media Corporation [300027:CH].

Removal of the limitation will be beneficial to most commercial banks in particular, smaller banks will be able to enlarge their asset base beyond their current meager deposit linked allowance, which will play a significant role in their profitability. From a macro perspective, easing of the policy may be a good way to stimulate the real economy, which is considered weak at the moment. The change in the Commercial Banking Law will lead the Chinese banking system to be more closely aligned with international standards, thus, new liquidity monitors will probably come from Basel III, such as LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) and NSFR (Net Stable Funding Ratio)."

The three companies are Beijing-based Air China Cargo, Shanghai-based China Cargo Airlines, and Guangzhou-based China Southern Cargo. Air China Cargo is a JV between Air China Limited [601111:CH] and Cathay Pacific Airways Limited [0293:HK]. China Cargo Airlines is a venture between China Eastern [600115:CH] and China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO). China Southern Cargo is an arm of China Southern Airlines [600029:CH].

Recent regulatory developments on the NTB have been centered on investor protection and misconduct on the market. This concession is likely driven by demand for external financing by SMEs as they continue to grow. Bank financing has proved difficult for mid-sized companies; new reforms have targeted additional financing for this segment, with newly launched private-sector banks basing their lending strategy on such companies. Backdoor listings are currently possible on the SSE and SZSE; extending this to the lower board is part of continued reforms to make capital markets more accessible.

      "contents": "China has begun to implement its massive government-led investment plans aiming to boost the development of its local semiconductor industry, injecting a planned total of RMB600bn into the industry over the next five years. Approximately 70 percent of the investment fund is being poured into the semiconductor manufacturing and equipment sectors\u2014with a focus on promoting locally produced logic chips, DRAM (data storage) and NAND flash memory (non-volatile storage technology that does not require power to retain date). The remaining funds will be allocated to design and backend sectors. The aim of this investment is to fulfill half of China\u2019s domestic demand for semiconductors with local products. Semiconductor and integrated circuit development has lagged in China, with only 3% of the world's integrated circuit business being conducted by Chinese chip companies. Meanwhile, China consumed USD99bn of integrated circuits in 2014.However, it is also estimated that China\u2019s domestic companies, which are mostly engaged in low-end equipment, accounts less than 15 percent of the market, leaving China\u2019s semiconductor industry with a long way to go. Chinese companies are also jumping on the band wagon, with BOE Technology [000725:CH] being approved to participate in a RMB30bn project today."

However, growing fears of being provided with shoddy products may influence future sales. In an increasingly competitive and saturated market, sustaining sales growth will depend on ensuring customer satisfaction, which is largely dependent on quality control of its goods. Governmental institutions such as the State Administration for Industry & Commerce (SAIC) and General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) have also acknowledged the growing importance of quality and thus launched an initiative to enhance product inspection in October 2014. Vipshop was also one of ten major online retailers, along with Alibaba [BABA:US] and JD.com [JD:US], to sign letters in accordance with the SAIC to implement a compensation system for unhappy consumers in May."

      "contents": "A comprehensive SOE reform plan is expected to be launched soon, which will include more mergers between powerful SOEs, in a bid to optimize resource allocation and address excessive competition. The merger of CSR Corp. and China CNR Corp. is regarded as a model for cooperation between key SOEs. China Power Investment Corp. and SNPTC also announced a similar restructuring model. Some centrally-administered SOEs look to enhance cooperation by forming joint ventures, which serves as another model for cooperation between big SOEs. For example, a wholly-owned subsidiary of China COSCO Holdings [601919:CH], COSCO Bulk Carrier Co., Ltd., has inked an agreement with China Shipping Development Co., Ltd. [600026:CH] to set up a JV in Singapore. It\u2019s been almost a year since six centrally-administered SOEs started a reform pilot last July; we are now seeing a renewed push for SOE reform. Despite calls for reforms of the state-owned sector, progress has been slow as there has been no national-level plan to implement. As a primary target of SOE reform in 2015, reform of central SOEs will be rolled out comprehensively after the top-level plan is introduced. Stocks related to the SOE reform concept have kept rising in general, and listed companies under the six pioneers have drawn much attention from the market, with their share prices greatly outperforming the CSI 300 Index; COFCO Property [000031.CH], SDIC XINJI ENERGY [601918.CH], Xinxing Ductile Iron Pipes [000778.CH], and China National Complete Import & Export [000151.CH] have increased over 40% since June, highlighting the appeal of SOE reform stocks to the market. Listed companies under central SOEs will likely continue to benefit from SOE reform moves."

Alibaba\u2019s entry to the internet literature market is relatively recent. A source at Tencent [0700:HK] said that the company was in closed door talks with Baidu [BIDU:US] about purchasing Baidu Literature, but was later denied by the latter. If this move had been completed, the industry would have been split between Tencent and Alibaba. Internet literature refers to novels, essays, poetry, or other literature that is distributed online. This phenomenon has gained widespread popularity in China and Tencent currently has over 2m pieces of literature available on its platform, with over 300,000 still under copyright. The top three bestsellers in 2014 brought an aggregate RMB103m, but the majority of online literature has very low revenue and the sector is widely considered as lacking a profitable business model. Despite this, online literature is becoming a battleground of the internet giants due to its large customer base. As competitors dwindle down, the introduction of a profitable model becomes increasingly likely."

China passed an amendment to its food safety law on April 23, which increased penalties on offenders. The new law goes into effect October 1. Food safety is a long-standing problem in China. Stricter laws and attention to the problem presents opportunities for large, well-run food production companies to gain market share. The government supports development of large-scale food companies that will be easier to supervise. China\u2019s agriculture and food industry is extremely fragmented, though there has been progress in recent years.

Two licenses were granted to managers in London, Harvest Global Investments and Insight Investment Management; others are Hi Asset Management from Seoul, and OCBC in Singapore. The new RQFII license in Hong Kong indicates that the hub's quota will be raised; we expect the new award will be significant, but may be pushed back to late 2H15 as regulators work on getting the SZ-HK Stock Connect and MFR programs up and running. Brunei Investment Agency is the latest SWF to join the QFII club. Despite expanding access for asset managers with Fidelity crossing the USD1bn mark, the program continues to be favored by asset owners; Norges Bank and HKMA remain the largest at USD2.5bn. Lyxor Asset Management's RMB6bn quota is tied with Deutsche AWM's for highest in Europe; we believe large initial quota grants in new hubs will continue as managers seek to fill out demand for investment into China."

China's weighting in the EMI currently stands at 25.26%, composed of Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong; this will rise significantly once the transition is made. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia will also be candidates for EMI inclusion in 2016. MSCI has chosen the same middle ground as FTSE. It is an understandable hedge considering the Chinese equity markets are not fully open to foreigners. However, the gains seen in A-shares in the last 12 months will tempt many. FTSE's transitional inclusion was quickly followed by Vanguard announcing its USD50bn Emerging Markets ETF [VWO:US] will physically include A-shares. We see this is a sign of things to come. Both index providers declined to include A-shares in their annual 2014 reviews, citing limited A-share accessibility, liquidity, and tax uncertainty with R/QFII. Capital gains taxation has been further clarified, but will be settled in July; accessibility has been addressed through increased R/QFII quota, an increased number of RQFII management hubs, as well as the stock connect program which will soon expand to cover Shenzhen. After two years of waiting, it is unlikely that announcement of inclusion in 2016 will be met with as much anticipation."

Yongche is an online car rental platform that provides self-driving car rentals, chauffeured bookings, and a taxi-booking app called DaChe Xiaomi. Yongche lags far behind market leader Didi Kuaidi. Yongche teased a deal with Uber in May 2015, though as of early June nothing had been announced. Yongche likely needs a firm partnership with a stronger player in order to survive the intense competition for China\u2019s on-demand car market."

      "contents": "So far, 20 brokerages have released financial statement for May, with mixed results.\u00a0 Eleven saw falling revenue, of which Pacific Securities [601099:CH] and CITIC Securities[600030:CH] are at the bottom with a 57.88% and 50% decrease respectively. Meanwhile, Orient Securities [600958:CH] saw profits increasing by 41.49% MoM, followed by Guo Yuan Securities [000728:CH] at 27% and CMS Securities [600999:CH] at 26%. For the nine brokerages with increased profits, growth rates are not as strong as previous months. That nearly half of brokerages profits fell in May comes as a surprise, considering transaction volumes on SZSE and SSE kept rising. One possible explanation is that commission fees are falling due to the impact of online brokerages. Another is that brokerages are relying heavily on non-fee income, such as margin trading and securities lending, which have been tightened following greater CSRC scrutiny on the risk they entail. We expect brokerages to continue to diversify their income, particularly as they raise new capital to expand."

There is added urgency now, as data from MoF shows that total revenue and profit of SOEs in 1Q15 dropped by 6% and 8% YoY respectively. Regulators want SOEs to reorder their balance sheets to ease the performance pressure brought on by falling profitability. SASAC says the market is big enough to absorb large SOEs ABS.

In the past two years, Beijing Adsit Media has shown negative profits, although revenue has continued to grow, reaching RB97.39m, an increase of 49% YoY.

A sales agent said home prices fell from RMB7,500 per sqm in 2007 to RMB5,000 per sqm now as there has not been enough demand to prop up prices.

Many of these cities are not able to absorb all the homes being built as population increase is not proportional with housing supply increase. There is also abundant land supply in smaller cities, which aggravated overbuilding. To cope with this problem, local governments are planning to restrict land supply and offer more favorable policies to attract more educated professional to work and live there."

Private fund managers have been given a triplet of bottom lines: stick to regulations, no public fundraising, and screening investors for suitability. Alternative investment managers have come under heavier regulation since 2008; AMAC\u2019s move indicates self-regulation may be used as a stepping stone to this in China."

The China-Korea FTA and preferential policies for cross-border e-commerce should play a role in supporting trade. However, with weak demand, any further growth will have to come from further market share gains, despite the fact that China is already the world\u2019s largest exporter."

According to an analysis by Bain & Company, Business to Consumer (B2C) online retail in China will grow three times faster than overall retail. With China\u2019s expanding e-commerce market, it\u2019s no surprise that MIIT wants to ensure that consumers engage in safe online payment behaviors. Youth and senior citizens were found to have the least awareness of safe behaviors."

Issued by banks and other financial institutions, NCDs will be issued to individual and institutions investors, and will be transferrable, allowing use as collateral. The investment threshold is 300,000 for individuals and RMB10m for institutions. The interest rate will float on Shibor. It is wildly considered that the launch of NCDs for non-financial institutions is a big step towards interest liberalization. It is notable that NCDs are transferable and can be early-redeemed, which provide more liquidity for current financial market. BMWPs and MMFs may become less popular among large bank depositors after the new rules come out."

Prices in second and third-tier cities fell by 0.1% and 0.3% in April compared to March prices. High inventories after a building boom over the last few years is a major issue, with Zhuzhou, in Hunan, seeing its highest-ever inventory of unsold homes. The backlog is now at 7m square meters, or 30 months-worth of sales. Despite efforts to boost sales with subsidies and discounts, sales volumes have been persistently weak in third and fourth-tier cities. Weak sales had led to cash flow issues at developers, which has led to some sales agents still being owed sales commissions for the last two years. Divergence between first-tier and lower-tier housing markets will continue as Shanghai, Shenzhen and Beijing continue to attract new residents, and smaller cities suffer from the oversupply and lack of scale compared to the largest cities. Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong real estate investment has accelerated significantly with growth reaching double digits. However, investment in real estate in the provinces of Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Yunnan, and Qinghai is declining. Inner Mongolia and Liaoning had property investment growth rates of -28.8% and -25.6% in Jan-April, a drastic difference from the national investment growth rate of 6%. Growth in Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Chongqing, Hubei, Henan, and others is substantially lower than the previous year as well. Third and fourth-tier cities account for 70 percent of housing supply, and prices cannot rise until inventory is digested by the market."

Electric car sales are dependent on subsidies and preferential driving regulations for electric cars, which are often restricted to domestically produced and pure electric cars. Electric car sales have doubled over last year, though absolute numbers remain low, with just over 8,000 sold in April. The domestic market-leader is BYD [1211:HK], which has developed its own battery technology. The company founded electric car brand Denza with Daimler Chrysler. Preferential driving regulations for domestic electric cars along with more convenient charging stations and big rebates will likely prove very attractive to consumers, as electric cars become more convenient.

The RMB10bn issuance is estimated to be issued in three tranches with registration valid for two years. The new system requires the disclosure of financial information regarding cash flow, historical statistical data, and information on other participating organizations. The new process makes issuance much simpler as companies no longer need to go through lengthy regulatory approval. This was expected to encourage ABS issuance; data for Q1 showed a stagnating market, reaching only RMB3.8bn out of the RMB500bn to RMB600bn previously projected for the entire 2015. As GMAC-SAIC is the first to take initiative under the new regulations, ABS issuance may begin to see increased popularity. This is not the first time the joint venture has helped set the trend in this market: it was also the second issuer of ABS back in 2012 after the suspension of issuance by regulators was lifted. A reduction in barriers and increased transparency is hoped to heighten issuance, investment and management efficiency."

As the SZ-HK stock connect continues to prepare for launch, further opening up mainland markets, international investors have realized a new opportunity to enter the market.

From 2010 to 2014, the pharmaceutical market in China grew from RMB675bn to RMB1.24t, good for 16.5% CAGR. Analysts say the M&A drive is driven by company valuations that are 2-5 times higher on the secondary market compared to the primary market. The upcoming new GMP standards raise the industry entry threshold so that many small companies would be forced to shut down or seek a buyer. Due to rising raw material costs and caps on medicine prices, the current 12% average profit growth for the pharmaceutical industry is much lower than the 20% the industry saw during its previous high-speed development period, leading larger companies to seek new growth drivers."

Avoiding a complete rebalancing of its benchmarks, FTSE will launch two new sub-indices for emerging markets, weighting A-shares according to the total available RQFII quota; total available quota currently is RMB920bn, against RMB363.7bn issued. Initial weighting of A-shares in the sub-indices will be 5%, rising to 32% when A-shares are fully available to international investors. This announcement comes before FTSE\u2019s annual review of its emerging markets index in November, and also right before MSCI announces its review on June 9. Wider A-share inclusion in both MSCI and FTSE indices has been the subject of debate, particularly after both declined to do so in their 2014 reviews. MSCI\u2019s Emerging Markets Index is currently weighted 25% towards Chinese stocks, but only those listed in Hong Kong. If A-shares are included, China\u2019s weight could rise to an unprecedented 50% if Taiwan and South Korea are reclassified as developed markets. FTSE\u2019s early announcement does tap into growing interest among global investors for exposure to China, while remaining a hedge against disinterest from mutual fund providers who may still perceive the market as risky."

UDICs are a tried and true method of helping local governments to deal with debt and develop necessary infrastructure. As muni bond issuance runs into friction from commercial banks and PPP struggles to take off, facilitating UDIC bond issuance meets short term local government needs. Higher returns are capable of attracting investors, but can also be problematic for the local government, as such, increasing UDIC bond issuance is likely only a stop-gap measure."

The new platform will be a joint venture between the securities company, NetEase Ltd [NTES:US], and Hainan Airlines Tourism Group Co., Ltd [600221:CH]. Capitalized with RMB100m, Everbright will contribute RMB40m with the latter two putting in RMB30m apiece. Beijing's Internet+ initiative has seen companies from diverse sectors scrambling for the online finance space. Two factors have made setting up online financial platforms attractive to different companies. Firstly, regulations are scant, allowing flexible business models; secondly, the success of Yu E Bao has demonstrated the distribution capability of the internet for financial products on the mainland. However, PBoC has moved to better regulate the shadow industry, drafting new measures for non-bank lending. In addition, increased competition and indistinct product offerings will likely squeeze out platforms without a ready user base."

It will be possible to complete and receive a loan within fifteen minutes and neither mortgage nor guarantee is required. The product is currently in private beta. As the first privately owned bank in China, one of WeBank\u2019s most important innovations is to create online account opening and remote authentication. The development of Wei Li Dai is consistent with this project. JD and Alibaba currently have similar loan products targeting individual and SMEs, however they are not under the supervision of CBRC. Once Wei Li Dai is successfully launched, it will become the first credit product by internet bank that approved by CBRC. Tencent may promote similar services to compete with JD and Alibaba by using its massive QQ and Wechat user base."

Lastly, MMFs are encouraged to develop better client-facing solutions, such as new payment services. Largely due to online distribution, MMF assets have increased dramatically since 2H13, growing from RMB304.2bn in June 2013 to RMB2.50tr in April 2015. Total MMF AUM is close to 50% of the mutual fund market. The regulations are aimed at avoiding concentration and systematic risks in case of large-scale redemptions.

Despite a large increase in 2015, ABS issuance in 1Q15 only reached RMB50.7bn, falling short of expectations. It has been argued that this may not be an opportune moment to expand the program, given the slowdown in China\u2019s economy, which in turn has depressed demand for credit. In such an environment, small banks are unable to find a market for large ABS issuances, while big banks would save their high quality credit assets. Regardless, the bullish stock market, coupled with low interest rates and low liquidity together make ABS less attractive to the market. Moreover, If the weak demand for credits persists, expanding ABS issuance may not significantly benefit banks as it will not ultimately improve bank asset turnover rates and ROE."

A source at the Ministry of Finance said there is a serious decline in fiscal revenue growth, while expenditures have been growing. To fill the gap and ease the pressure on financial subsidies, the Chinese government is working on transferring state-owned assets to help bolster social security funds. In the early days of China\u2019s National Social Security Fund, the main source of funds came from government fiscal allocations, holdings in SOEs, lottery revenue and investment income. However, with SOE reform, holdings in SOEs will end, meaning new sources of financing are needed just as obligations will be growing with the aging of China\u2019s population. The Third Plenary Session of 18th CPC Central Committee confirmed plans to allocate state-owned assets to the social security funds. China has also recently expanded the scope of investment allowed by social security funds, including the purchase of corporate and local government debt."

According to company chairman Wang Xinchun, prospects for the coal industry remain dim. In recent years, domestic companies, key SOEs and top internet companies in particular, have rushed to issue dollar denominated bonds. Increasing cases of default and economic growth dipping to the lowest level since 1990 have led to concern from the market. Ongoing reforms to fixed income markets on the mainland are in part targeted at removing the implicit guarantee a number of companies were deemed to have.

ABS has failed to attract the interest of both banks and investors. Successive interest rate cuts have severely curtailed the attractiveness of ABS, and between March and April, the recommended interest rate for A-1 ABS was the same as that for A-2. ABS returns are also lower than that of BWMPs, which banks have likely been reluctant to pass up. This is bad news for many Chinese companies who may be looking to restructure their debt through new ABS issuance.

Weak trade, inflation and PMI data for April highlight the continued challenges facing the Chinese economy. The stock market also faltered last week, with the Shanghai Index declining 5.3%. In addition to being a monetary policy to support a slowing economy, the greater discretion given banks to set deposit rates are part of a range of gradual adjustments to China\u2019s banking system with a goal for interest rate liberalization within the year. In keeping with regulators\u2019 dislike for shocks to the system, we can expect the interest rate flotation boundary to be slowly adjusted every few months until it is functionally liberalized, and trends seem to indicate that the benchmark rate might be further cut in a few months if the economy does not seem to be meeting growth targets."

As the leading company in IC card security, Tongfang, has a chance at breaking the overseas technical monopoly. Currently there are about 4bn bank cards in China\u2019s market, indicating huge potential."

Once the separation between credit and debit card fees is put into effect, the bank will bear the cost and risk of bad debts which, in addition to marketing costs, will make credit card fees higher than those for debit cards. Differential pricing will affect consumer behavior and breed arbitrage risk, which is not conducive to the Chinese government objectives steady growth and expanding domestic demand."

      "contents": "Only nine companies went public today as opposed to the expected ten. Three companies listed on the Shanghai main board, five on ChiNext, and one on the SME board. Red Dragonfly, a clothing retailer, announced yesterday that it was delaying its IPO after the issuer received a report of unknown content. It is suspected that the report was from a competitor and mentioned a civil suit. The company has been involved in several lawsuits in recent years, some of which are still unresolved. Xinjiang Xuefeng Sci-Tech [603227:CH] was the largest IPO of the day, raising RMB408.4mn. Red Dragonfly was one of 98 companies approved in April to go public, despite its somewhat checkered background. All companies that listed in the month of April hit the +10% trading limit each day during April. This underscores issues in both China\u2019s IPO system as well as current bullish attitudes. IPOs often have a P/E ratio far lower than industry average, for example Ctrowell [300455:CH] has a P/E ratio of 18.11 as opposed to its industry average of 71.92. In combination with the +10% trading cap, it is difficult for new companies to settle at a reasonable price, as can be seen in the case of market darling Beijing Baofeng [300431:CH] whose 29 day post IPO trading cap streak finally ended today."

China\u2019s total foreign trade declined 6.3% in 1Q15 to RMB5.54tr. Total exports were up 4.9% to RMB3.15tr, while imports fell by 17.3% to RMB2.39tr. As a barometer of the foreign trade market, orders at the recently-ended Canton Fair fell 10%. Although the global economy is recovering, demand from other countries is still weak. Facing increasing global challenges and a ceiling on international market share, it will be difficult for China\u2019s foreign trade volume to increase significantly. However, opportunities from the \u2018Belt and Road\u2019 program should begin to have an impact soon. With this report, MOFCOM is looking to preemptively soothe the foreign trade sector, saying that current low trade volume is not the end of the world."

The Chinese authorities have given a lot of lip service to supporting SMEs, which struggle to compete with favored SOEs and are often unable to secure financing from banks, which is needed to develop innovative services. As increasing wages begin to cause production to shift Southeast Asia and other regions, SMEs, which typically focus on low-tech light manufacturing, are being particularly hard hit. Facing difficulties dealing with rising costs resulting from changing demographics and increasing mechanization, many ailing manufacturing SMEs require external capital to innovate in order to survive."

The law currently mandates a maximum LTD of 75%, with the industry holding a monthly average of 65.9% in 2014. The LTD has been criticized in the past as a collar on the banks' ability to manage their own assets. As a measure of liquidity, LTD has fallen out of favor as the liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio come into vogue under the Basel III accord. CBRC has made a deliberate effort to harmonize domestic regulation with international norms under Basel. The changes earlier made by CBRC will see up to RMB8.6tr reclassified as deposits in 2015, allowing banks to lend more. Other proposals include formal adoption of the internet+ policy to bring online finance into the regulatory fold.

While short term, these numbers are a good sign for real estate as March is often considered a high period for home sales. However, it remains to be seen whether this policy-driven growth represents real underlying market demand or simply opportunistic speculators. A further complicating factor is that due to time delay, the real estate inventory is continuing to grow following the previous real estate boom. Rocky roads are likely still ahead for China\u2019s real estate sector, but China\u2019s large and increasingly affluent population, along with government intervention, are likely to prevent the situation from becoming overly dire and the market may have already bottomed out."

CITIC Securities acquired CLSA from French bank Credit Agricole [ACA:FP] in July 2013. CITIC Securities is China's largest securities company by revenue, earning RMB39.5bn in 2014, up 94% YoY. CITIC's overseas investment banking expansion comes as global counterparts consider scaling back in response to growing regulatory compliance costs. One option for larger European banks has been to spin off their investment banking divisions; Credit Suisse has faced pressure from shareholders to focus instead on its wealth and asset management core. CITIC CLSA is not alone in its venture outward: Haitong International [6837:HK] announced a new issue of H-shares in December 2014 to fund an expansion, in a bid to double its international business.\u00a0 CITIC becomes the first Chinese securities house with a global footprint and more will likely follow."

The lower leverage ratios are expected to slow down the stock market\u2019s momentum in the long run, compounded by the increasing number of IPOs soaking up liquidity in the market. Tebon Securities has increased margin\u00a0requirements and shortened the list of stocks acceptable as collateral, pulling away from companies on Shenzhen\u2019s SME board. Among the brokerages readjusting requirements, Huatai Securities [601688:CH] and Haitong Securities [6837:HK] had lowered discount rates for purchases of selected stock on margin in mid-April, to create an additional risk buffer. Brokerages are eager to tame margin trading risk in case of a correction in share price. Regardless, it has been a strong year for brokerage performance and profit, largely driven by rallying A-shares and growth in their margin lending business. As CSRC continues to push more stringent enforcement of margin trading rules, brokerages will have to balance their growth ambitions with better risk management. We expect to see larger players diversifying their business lines even as they allocate more resources to profitable margin lending operations. Those that will be unable to do so will likely see their profits decrease significantly in 2015. Brokerages posted record profits in 2014; Haitong led in the first tier with 89.4% profit growth YoY."

A total of 73,000 enterprises are currently involved in the EA scheme, with a total of 22.9 million individuals covered. These figures are skewed towards large SOEs and urban workers, however. The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Services expanded EA\u2019s investment scope in 2013, allowing BWMP, trust product and stock option investments. With this broadened scope, we believe EA managers will introduce more competitive products, such as trust-related offerings, in order to maximize yields and expand coverage of the working population."

GDP growth in 1Q15 barely met the official target of 7% and intervention may become necessary to realize that goal, the lowest set by policymakers since the financial crisis. Despite reiterations of the \u201cnew normal\u201d, China\u2019s regulators are uncomfortable with slowing growth and the perception of non-action. Policy specifics include increasing the scope of small and micro businesses eligible for tax reductions, government directed investment focusing on large infrastructure projects rather than real estate or manufacturing, and integration of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, with an expected RMB42tn in investments over the next six years. Projects will focus on transportation, real estate, and environmental protection as well as expanding the finance capabilities available in Beijing to the whole region. These wide ranging policies indicate that there is no clear factor held responsible for slowing GDP and that varying tools will be used to see what works. If these are unable to stimulate growth over 7% in 2Q15, more stimulus policies will likely be introduced in late summer."

China\u2019s stock markets were up in morning trading despite the weak PMI, which suggests there is broad expectation for this to happen. The HSBC PMI and China\u2019s official PMI surveys have different sample groups, which helps account for the different numbers. HSBC\u2019s survey tends to include more small and medium sized companies, while the official China PMI is focused more on large manufacturers.

Chinese futures companies were given access to the market earlier in April and PBoC granted access to the IBB to more non-financial firms in late 2014."

CSRC implemented new IPO rules in 2013, with one of the goals to protect secondary market investors from high-priced IPO shares that often soon fell below their issue price. The result is that IPOs are priced drastically lower than the average PE ratio for their industry. There has not been a single IPO priced above 23 times earnings since July 2014, while the average PE ratio for stocks on the ChiNext board, where many IPOs are listed, is nearly 100."

Trusts would be designated to each depending upon their registered capital and track record, although specifics have not yet been published. The growth tier will see its business severely restricted to only the most basic of products, while the innovative tier can engage in essentially any existing trust business it chooses, and potentially more. Until now, all types of trusts have received equal treatment by regulators. China has been attempting to rein in risk in the trust sector for some time, gradually increasing capital requirements for the last few years. The need for such regulation can be seen in the case of the New China Trust, a Barclays [BCS:US] joint venture, which was plagued by defaults. In response, the new regulations have also introduced leverage and concentration ratio requirements. Many of the smaller trusts will be forced to increase their registered capital or face being cut out entirely. The flexible nature of the trust industry encourages product innovation, making it a possibly attractive platform for foreign entry. Moves towards this can be seen in recent measures opening trust companies to foreign control. It is expected that ownership reform will eventually be expanded to the entire financial sector, with industry sources speculating that insurance companies may be next."

RMB slipped from fifth to seventh in its share of global payments according to SWIFT data, falling from 2.06% of total payments to 1.81%. China has been actively promoting the use of its currency, aiming to challenge the incumbent reserve currencies. Currency internationalization and its corollary of increased outflows have roused concern over possible macroeconomic repercussions. Increased non-banking cross border payments suggests greater capital account activity, which is desired from the perspective of IMF SDR inclusion. This would be supported by recent moves to further liberalize foreign currency exchange in the FTZs.

Thanks to the raging bull A-share markets, potential pitfalls for mutual funds were avoided, with most managers able to ride the market upswing regardless of specific stock or sector selection.

According to statistics from an HR company, around 70% of people who intend to move to private funds have more than 5 years\u2019 background in investment banking, and the rest are most often from the management consulting industry or the big four audit firms. Domestic PFMs are especially of interest. Banking industry salaries have suffered a decline since the start of 2015 as part of a chain reaction due to SOE reform. However, this is not the only reason that contributes to bankers moving to PFMs, as payment in some domestic private fund firms may not be as high as what banks could offer. The domestic private fund industry in China is currently thriving, with capital participation reaching USD73bn in 2014, a 101% increase YoY. Therefore, earning potential and job flexibility are likely the most significant considerations."

Details on Jiangsu\u2019s bond issuance, originally scheduled for release on April 16, have not been disclosed. Analysts expect that banks will lose between RMB500,000 to RMB2m for every RMB100m of municipal bonds underwritten. Despite MoF assurances that muni bonds will have a higher rate of return than similar national government bonds, advantages to investors are unclear, as munis are not as liquid and do not have as high a rate of return as top-rated SOE bonds. This is the largest scale issuance of muni bonds so far, approximately four times that in 2014, and interest rates will be determined by bidding."

A large number of IPOs is generally seen as a negative for market sentiment, as the amount of new share supply disperses investor funds. However, the strong secondary market performance of IPOs in 2015 has many investors clamoring for pre-IPO subscriptions. During a strong market, CSRC typically increases the rate of IPO approvals; when markets are weak, IPOs may completely stop, as they did for all of 2013. The accelerated pace of approvals could also be seen as a way for CSRC to throw a cold towel on an overheating market. Chinese regulators continue to pursue a healthier IPO market, with the latest plan calling for responsibility of IPO approvals to move from CSRC to the respective stock exchanges, although a date for the change has yet to be confirmed. We expect to continue seeing a large number of IPO approvals in the coming months as CSRC tries to digest the considerable backlog of companies in the IPO pipeline."

More importantly, SAFE has stated that proposals for QDII reform include phasing out the quota system altogether.

At the same time, Qilu Bank announced it was planning to invest RMB2bn in shares of more than 30 companies. This plan is still awaiting CBRC\u2019s approval. The company\u2019s New Third Board IPO is largely in order to supplement capital.\u00a0 By the end of 2014, Qilu Bank\u2019s capital adequacy ratio was 11.15% and its Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio is 9.99%, and it saw a large increase in its inter-bank business. Compared with financing via IPO, listing on the New Third Board would allow the issuance of OTC preference shares and a shorter approval time, which is more effective for supplementing Tier 1 capital. As the process of interest liberalization speeds up, many banks are finding this a suitable time to increase capital in order to stay competitive. Meanwhile, since the regulations for shadow banking have gotten stricter, it is likely an increasing number of small banks will enter the New Third Board, especially city and rural commercial banks."

PBOC also approved a draft for policy bank reform yesterday and further clarified the position policy banks should hold in China\u2019s banking system. While the most obvious factor in injecting such a large amount into policy banks is preparation for the One Belt One Road initiative. This comes after China\u2019s recent move to decrease U.S. debt holdings; a similar move was considered in 2009 when RMB200bn was planned the Exim Bank to counter a sharp rise in foreign reserves.

[1638:HK] on April 20 became the first property developer to default on U.S. dollar debt after it failed to make a USD52m interest payment due on offshore bonds as a 30-day grace period expired. Subsequently, power equipment maker Baoding Tianwei Group Co., based in Hebei, may become the first state-owned enterprise to fail to repay debt. The company said it does not have RMB85.5m due on April 21 for interest payments on RMB1.5bn of bonds issued in 2011. Tianwei Group\u2019s listed affiliate Baoding Tianwei Baobian Electric Co Ltd [600550:CH] meanwhile has risen 82% over the last six months on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Tianwei Group is itself a subsidiary of China South Industries Group Corporation, a major central SOE. This week\u2019s potential defaults mark the third and fourth times Chinese borrowers have failed to make payments on time. We expect this trend to accelerate, and will be watching for these defaults to push investor sentiment away from seeing bonds as a zero-risk bet. It is unclear what fate awaits holders of Kaisa and Tianwei bonds. Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. was the first corporate bond issuer to default when it failed to pay back RMB1bn due in March 2014. However, bondholders were later made whole in a restructuring plan that involved guarantees from a government-run asset management group. Cloud Live Technology Group [002306:CH] announced on April 3 that it had missed a principal repayment of RMB240m on RMB400m in debt sold in 2012. No further announcements have been made on the issue. Both Kaisa and Cloud Live have seen their business hurt by the ongoing corruption crackdown in China."

Consequently, CSRC later clarified in an interview transcript posted to the official CSRC Weibo that this was not the case. CSRC\u2019s statement does not affect margin trading that is conducted according to already established regulations and was largely intended to address umbrella trusts which CSRC considers overly risky due to high leverage, difficulty of supervision; trusts will continue to issue these products.

Dividend assumptions would contribute to the differences between the two futures, but does not explain the difference between the CSI 500 index and its futures. There has been talk from Hong Kong about introducing index futures to the Stock Connect. The CSI 500 is the underlying index for Deutsche Hvst CSI500 ChA [ASHS:US] and SSE 50 is the underlying index for W.I.S.E.-SSE 50 China Tracker [3024:HK] among other offshore ETFs."

Established as a manager for distressed assets at China Construction Bank [0939:HK], Cinda and other 'bad banks' have grown on the proliferation of non-performing loans in the Chinese banking industry. Cinda's distressed debt under management grew 80% in 2014, and the firm anticipates greater growth in 2015 on the back of increasing NPLs. The company first listed in Hong Kong in 2013 and has indicated a secondary A-share listing, either on the SSE or SZSE, is under consideration. For 2014,\u00a0net profits stood at RMB11.9bn, a 31.8% increase on the previous year. The bonds are expected to appeal to investors searching for higher yield away from the US and Europe."

Minsheng Bank [1988:HK] announced such a program in November, and the two will possibly be joined soon by Ping An Bank [000001:CH]. CMB share were suspended in preparation for this announcement but resumed trading today. ESOPs are growing more common in China in order to increase the retention rates in the financial sector. They remain relatively uncommon among China\u2019s banks, but the government has recently been encouraging such programs to motivate mid and high-level employees, especially as limits on salaries for upper management have been introduced. More banks are expected to follow suit in order to increase retention and boost profitability."

      "title": "Trust Company IPO Regulations Clarified",
      "contents": "The CBRC has outlined for the first time regulations for trust companies to IPO. Companies that wish to go public must have RMB1bn in net assets by the end of the previous quarter, net profits of RMB1bn in the last three years, and be one of the top fifteen companies in the industry by size. Trust companies that wish to IPO through an SPV or on ChiNext have lower requirements, such as net profits of RMB500mn and must be one of the top thirty companies in the industry. Currently, only two trust companies have gone public. China continues to further regulate and standardize its unwieldy shadow banking sector. Trust companies are often used as vehicles for risky investments by parent companies. Clear regulations will facilitate trust company IPOs, leading to increased independence from parent companies and better core business management. With the new focus on SOE reform, handy trusts are being targeted as a way to encourage responsible risk taking, as up to a third of trusts are owned by banks."

      "title": "Ping An Ventures into Crowd Funding",
      "contents": "Ping An Group [2318:HK] has announced that it is establishing a crowd funding platform. Although crowd funding has existed in China for years, it was largely a niche area. Ecommerce stalwarts Alibaba [BABA:US]and JD [JD:US] have recently begun to focus on crowd funding in earnest and adjust their related business models. They are now joined by several Ping An group companies. Ping An has been aggressively expanding in online financial services in recent months. Both eCommerce and financial companies are diving into internet financing, putting them in competition with China\u2019s state owned banks. They are attempting to take advantage of technological efficiency, lower costs, and first-mover advantages that can be gained in a sector with little precedent or regulation. An ultimate winner is unclear, however, Ping An\u2019s entry indicates traditional financial players will angle for this segment."

      "title": "Multiple A-share Accounts Now Possible",
      "contents": "China Securities Depository and Clearing Co Ltd (CSDC) has lifted the cap on single A-share and closed-end fund brokerage accounts for domestic investors. Investors will be able to open up to 20 trading accounts with different brokerages starting from April 13. The single account rule has in the past tied Chinese investors to securities companies even when service was below par, given the painstaking process of transferring accounts between firms. This new adjustment follows the unification of Shanghai and Shenzhen clearing systems in October 2014, meaning investors do not have to open separate accounts for each exchange. While investors will maintain a single CSDC account, multiple brokerage accounts will force securities companies to enhance service delivery to retain their custom. The A-share rally has stoked demand for trading accounts with new openings surging by 13.73m in the last 6 months. Some industry sources have attributed this in part to individuals opening multiple accounts. This new provision will cut down on this practice, as well as enhance competition between brokerages."
