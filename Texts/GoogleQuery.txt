Fermat's mathematical work was communicated mainly in letters to friends, often with little or no proof of his theorems. Although he himself claimed to have proved all his arithmetic theorems, few records of his proofs have survived, and many mathematicians have doubted some of his claims, especially given the difficulty of some of the problems and the limited mathematical tools available to Fermat.
